in the script lore.py:
- No need for two identical classes if what they differ for is the generation strategy. Just pass the generation strategy as a parameter to the constructor.

Lore_sa/test/test_lore.py:
- In the testing script under the test folder only the TabularRandomGeneratorLore is tested. The other generator is not tested.

- Overall why the generation has been splitted into serveral scripts? Furthermore they don't even follow a naming convention! It would be better to have a single script with the range of choices for the generation strategy? This would make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

- the .gitignore is missing the .pyc files. (those files are generated by python and should not be commited to the repository)




Solutions for the genetic:
- Genetic is python based (or at least cython)
- No parallelism at all? (has to be done "by hand?")
- I don't know if the 
    (btw 1-hot sucks; "import categorical-encoding as ce" is the way)
- A parallelizabile version should be easy to implement (just run the algo on sequential chunks of the samples to create CF for, and then merge the results, (if all are present), but still save the intermediate results for each chunk)
